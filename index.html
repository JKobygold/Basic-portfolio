    <h2>About me</h2>
     <p> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their
          creator with certain unalienable rights,
            that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers
          from the consent Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Pariatur suscipit repudiandae quaerat sit accusamus modi perferendis atque officiis, reprehenderit, fugit officia. Modi, quis mollitia odit odio blanditiis quia consectetur non. of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.
